# vim-tips

A vim random tips bot that can be plugged in any bot provider (prove of concept)

# Why?

This is just a prove of concept that it's possible to abstract away any bot api
using some dependency injection and pluggable code.

# Why VIM?

Well, because of the first rule of the Vim's club. "Always talk about VIM". So
it's funny to have a vim bot that does exactly that and I can automate away it
from my responsabilities as a VIM user. :P

# Providers

 [  ] Slack
 [  ] Telegram
 [  ] Others?
