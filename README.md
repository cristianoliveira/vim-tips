# vim-tips

A vim random tips bot that can be plugged in any bot provider (prove of concept)

# Why?

Practice Typescript, and because why not?

# Why VIM?

Well, because of the first rule of the Vim's club. "Always talk about VIM". So
it's funny to have a vim bot that does exactly that and I can automate away it
from my responsabilities as a VIM user. :P
